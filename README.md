# Litch
Litch is a **work-in-progress** application for streamers to improve interactability and fun.

## Design
Litch uses a modular approach to allow dynamically loading:

  * **Services** for providing Twitch integration, bot support, etc.
  * **Modules** for providing overlay effects such as falling snow, fireworks, PNG tubers, and more

With this design, third-party additions to add custom functionality are just self-contained NPM packages.
